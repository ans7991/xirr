Rate of Return for transactions at irregular interval

XIRR is a term used for denoting rate of return on transactions at irregular interval. Suppose you made following transactions:

* Invested $1000 on 1st Jan 2014
* Invested $1500 on 5th April 2014
* Invested $800 on 16th Sept 2014
* Withdraw $2200 on 19th Nov 2014
* Invested $3000 on 3rd Feb 2015
* Withdrew $4500 on 30 June 2015

Then the XIRR for cashflow is 10.3 % p.a.
